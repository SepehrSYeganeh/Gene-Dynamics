# Gene Dynamics

This repository contains the group project for the *Selected Topics in Statistical Physics* course.  
We study the dynamics of gene regulatory network of AML using tools from nonlinear dynamics.

## Features
- **Fixed point analysis** – Find fixed points and classify the type of dynamics around them (e.g., stable, unstable)
- **Clustering** – Group fixed points based on their stability or other dynamical properties
- **Parameter learning** – Estimate or infer dynamical parameters from simulations or data

## Repository Structure
- `genedyn/`
  - `src/` – Core simulation and analysis code
  - `io/` – Input/output handling 
- `data/` – Generated results from simulations
- `fig/` – Plots and visualizations
